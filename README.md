## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the closing stock prices of Power Grid Corporation using historical data. We implement three different models:

1. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Each model goes through:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Data Preprocessing

- Training and testing the model

- Stock analysis using charts

- Evaluating the model

- Predicting the stock prices

## Models Used

1. **LSTM**: A type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) suitable for time series data.

2. **SVM**: Support Vector Regressor (SVR) is a supervised learning model that uses the concept of hyperplanes for regression tasks.

3. **KNN**: A simple algorithm that stores all available cases and predicts based on a similarity measure (e.g., distance functions).
